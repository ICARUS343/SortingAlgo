# SortingAlgo
Contains code which compares runtime for unsorted, sorted, reverse sorted, and partially sorted arrays of integers using Java Default sort, Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort. 

Takes in two arguments:
    1. file name: The text file which contains the unsorted integers. 
    2. integer(0-5) 0 being the default. 0 Selects the type of algorithm used. 
        a. 0: Java Default
        b. 1: Bubble Sort
        c. 2: Selection Sort
        d. 3: Insertion Sort
        e. 4: Merge Sort
        f. 5: Quick Sort
Outputs: Name of array used 
         4 runtimes for 
                a. Unsorted array from the text file.
                b. Sorted array from the text file.
                c. Reverse Sorted array from the text file.
                d. Partially Sorted array: 90% Sorted.
Writes fours txt file:
        1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt and 4.txt contains sorted array.
